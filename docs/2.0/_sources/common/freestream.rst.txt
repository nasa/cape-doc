Setting Freestream Conditions in Cape
=====================================

Setting freestream conditions for the various solvers in Cape is controlled from
the JSON file (e.g. :file:`pyCart.json`) and the run matrix file.  Varying
freestream conditions like Mach number, angle of attack, sideslip angle,
temperature, and pressure is one of the most common ways to use Cape or any
other CFD wrapper.

Cape adds a few capabilities to this procedure that are not exactly typical.
The freestream conditions are divided into two groups.  The first group sets the
orientation of the velocity relative to the CFD domain, and the second group
sets the freestream state.


.. _cape-alpha-beta:

Angle of Attack and Sideslip
----------------------------
Most CFD solvers need an input angle of attack and sideslip angle, commonly
known as *alpha* and *beta*, respectively.  Cape recognizes this and provides
both as standard input variables.  However, there is another convention that is
especially common in the missile and launch vehicle fields that uses the total
angle of attack and roll angle.  The parameters are related using the following
two equations.

    .. math::
    
        \tan\alpha &= \cos\phi_p\tan\alpha_p \\
        \sin\beta  &= \sin\phi_p\sin\alpha_p

The total angle of attack is the angle between the body *x* axis (or the *x*
axis of the CFD coordinate system) and the velocity, and the roll angle gives
the angle of the velocity projected into the CFD *yz* plane.
        
CAPE also provides *aoap* (a.k.a. *alpha_t*) and *phip* (a.k.a. *phi*) as
variables for the user, and it automatically calculates *alpha* and *beta*
accordingly.

    **alpha**: :class:`dict`
    
        *Group*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            Whether or not to consider the angle of attack as a group key
            
        *Type*: ``"alpha"``
            RunMatrix key type, must be ``"alpha"`` for this type of key
            
        *Value*: ``"float"``
            Name of Python type for this key, must be :class:`float`
            
        *Label*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the folder name
            
        *Abbreviation*: {``"a"``} | :class:`str`
            Abbreviation for this variable when creating folder names
        
        *Format*: {``"%s"``} | ``"%.2f"`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the folder
            
        *PBSLabel*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the PBS job name
            
        *PBSFormat*: {``%.1f``} | ``%s`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the PBS job
            
    **beta**: :class:`dict`
    
        *Group*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            Whether or not to consider the angle of attack as a group key
            
        *Type*: ``"beta"``
            RunMatrix key type, must be ``"beta"`` for this type of key
            
        *Value*: ``"float"``
            Name of Python type for this key, must be :class:`float`
            
        *Label*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the folder name
            
        *Abbreviation*: {``"b"``} | :class:`str`
            Abbreviation for this variable when creating folder names
        
        *Format*: {``"%s"``} | ``"%.2f"`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the folder
            
        *PBSLabel*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the PBS job name
            
        *PBSFormat*: {``%.1f``} | ``%s`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the PBS job
            
        *SkipIfZero*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            If set, skip this in the folder name.  For example, a folder name
            would be ``m2.5a1.0`` instead of ``m2.5a1.0b0.0``.

If the user names a trajectory key *alpha* or *beta*, these settings
automatically get applied.  However, the user can alter the default settings in
the JSON file or use a different variable name.  If the variable name is
something completely different, like ``"TV"``, the *Type* flag can still define
the variable as an angle of attack.  See the following example.

    .. code-block:: javascript
    
        "TV": {
            "Type": "alpha",
            "Format": "%05.2f"
        }
        
Setting the *Format* flag to has two purposes.  The first is to keep a
consistent number of characters and have the folder names sorted in a more
logical order.  For example, ``a10.00`` comes before ``a2.00`` but not
``a02.00``.  The second reason for using *Format* other than ``"%s"`` is to trim
extra digits.  This avoids having folder names such as ``a2.7893478247``.

The second way to define the flow angles is using *alpha_t* and *phi*.

    **alpha_t**, **aoap**: :class:`dict`
    
        *Group*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            Whether or not to consider the angle of attack as a group key
            
        *Type*: ``"alpha_t"``
            RunMatrix key type, must be ``"alpha_t"`` for this type of key
            
        *Value*: ``"float"``
            Name of Python type for this key, must be :class:`float`
            
        *Label*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the folder name
            
        *Abbreviation*: {``"a"``} | :class:`str`
            Abbreviation for this variable when creating folder names
        
        *Format*: {``"%s"``} | ``"%.2f"`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the folder
            
        *PBSLabel*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the PBS job name
            
        *PBSFormat*: {``%.1f``} | ``%s`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the PBS job
            
    **phi**, **phip**: :class:`dict`
    
        *Group*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            Whether or not to consider the angle of attack as a group key
            
        *Type*: ``"phi"``
            RunMatrix key type, must be ``"phi"`` for this type of key
            
        *Value*: ``"float"``
            Name of Python type for this key, must be :class:`float`
            
        *Label*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the folder name
            
        *Abbreviation*: {``"r"``} | :class:`str`
            Abbreviation for this variable when creating folder names
        
        *Format*: {``"%s"``} | ``"%.2f"`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the folder
            
        *PBSLabel*: {``True``} | ``False``
            Whether or not to use the value of this key in the PBS job name
            
        *PBSFormat*: {``%.1f``} | ``%s`` | :class:`str`
            Print flag for the name of the PBS job
            
        *SkipIfZero*: ``True`` | {``False``}
            If set, skip this in the folder name.  For example, a folder name
            would be ``m2.5a1.0`` instead of ``m2.5a1.0r0.0``.


.. _cape-state:

Freestream State
----------------
The rest of the freestream variables are Mach number, freestream temperature,
and freestream pressure or something equivalent. Cart3D is an inviscid solver,
and only needs the Mach number, but even then defining a freestream state can
be useful for post-processing or providing a reference for thrust values
(since thrust coefficient depends on dynamic pressure).

OVERFLOW and FUN3D use freestream static temperature and Reynolds number per
unit grid length as input variables. Calculating this Reynolds number is not
particularly challenging, but Cape makes it easy to just specify freestream
static pressure or freestream dynamic pressure instead. Cape will automatically
calculate *Re* using the temperature and either static pressure or dynamic
pressure when setting up a case. Conversely, the user may define *Re* in the
standard manner, and it will automatically calculate the freestream static and
dynamic pressures and several other common state variables:

    * :func:`cape.runmatrix.RunMatrix.GetPressure`
    * :func:`cape.runmatrix.RunMatrix.GetDynamicPressure`
    * :func:`cape.runmatrix.RunMatrix.GetTotalPressure`
    * :func:`cape.runmatrix.RunMatrix.GetTemperature`
    * :func:`cape.runmatrix.RunMatrix.GetTotalTemperature`.

Finally, most codes also allow the user to specify non-default values of the
freestream ratio of specific heats, which can be done using the *gamma* run
matrix variable type.

Each of these trajectory key types are *mach*, *T*, *Re*, *gamma*, *p*, and
*q*.
