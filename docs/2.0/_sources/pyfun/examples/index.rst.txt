Examples Using pyFun
=====================

Example projects that demonstrate how to use pyCart can be found in
``$CAPE/examples/pyfun/`` where ``$CAPE`` is the folder in which Cape is
installed. The examples are intended to roughly increase in capability in an
interactive fashion to initiate users to the various capabilities of pyFun and
FUN3D.

The first two examples are designed to initiate users to basic usage that is
relevant to any pyFun project, and the remaining examples try to introduce more
complex features one at a time.
