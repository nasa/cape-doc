</li>
<li><p>Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject
Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator of
its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In
fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file
(e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the
date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a
Modification, for example, by including a statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software
provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not
thereafter be revoked.</p></li>
<li><p>A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software.
Once a copyright notice has been added to the Subject Software, a
Recipient may not remove it without the express permission of the
Contributor who added the notice.</p></li>
<li><p>A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or
in any promotional, advertising or other material that may be construed
as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any prior Recipient of any
product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain
commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency’s or a prior
Recipient’s participation in this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject
Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is
requested to provide Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government
Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., the following
information: name and email. Recipient’s name and personal information
shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a
Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform
Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point of Contact
listed in clause 5.F., how to access the Modification.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be
Contributor’s original creation and does not violate any existing
agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor
has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other
Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only
on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such
warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by
that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify
Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred
by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
offered by such Recipient.</p></li>
<li><p>A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with
separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the
Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included
in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put
on notice that export of any goods or technical data from the United
States may require some form of export license from the U.S. Government.
Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a
license shall not be required nor that, if required, it shall be issued.
Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.</p></li>
